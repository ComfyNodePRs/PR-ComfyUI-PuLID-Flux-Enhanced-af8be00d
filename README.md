# ComfyUI-PuLID-Flux-Enhanced
adapted from https://github.com/balazik/ComfyUI-PuLID-Flux

## some new features
add common fusion methods for multi-image input: mean(default), concat, max...etc

add some experimental fusion methods, using the norm of the conditions to weight them, and novel very fast self training methods...etc

add a switch between using gray image (default) and using rgb. in some cases, use gray image will bring detail loss
